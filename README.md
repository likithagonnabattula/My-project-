# My-project-
# Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple content-based movie recommendation system built with Python and Streamlit.

## Features
- Uses movie metadata (overview and genres) to recommend similar movies.
- Uses CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to find recommendations.
- Interactive web app interface powered by Streamlit.
- Provides top 5 movie recommendations based on a given movie title.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for creating the web app UI)

## How It Works
1. Loads a CSV file (`movies.csv`) containing movie data.
2. Combines movie overview and genres into a single text feature.
3. Converts the combined text into feature vectors using CountVectorizer.
4. Calculates similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity.
5. Displays recommendations interactively using Streamlit.

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit
Place movies.csv in your project folder.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run your_script_name.py
Use the input box on the web page to enter a movie title and get recommendations.

Note: This project demonstrates a basic movie recommendation system with an easy-to-use web interface.

Feel free to explore and enhance the app further!
